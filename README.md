# STM32 Fundamentals

A hands-on STM32 embedded systems learning project based on the [ControllersTech STM32 Beginner Course](https://controllerstech.com/stm32-beginner-course-learn-stm32-from-scratch/).

The primary target is the **NUCLEO-F446RE (STM32F446RE)**.

Selected earlier exercises were adapted to the **STM32F103C8T6 (Blue Pill)** and tested in **Wokwi** as an auxiliary simulation environment.

## Current Progress

### Clock Configuration

- System clock configured with STM32CubeMX.
- Primary STM32F446RE project configured for a 180 MHz system clock.
- A separate STM32F103C8T6 configuration is used for Wokwi simulation.

### GPIO

- Configured GPIO output with STM32 HAL.
- Implemented LED blinking using:
  - `HAL_GPIO_WritePin()`
  - `HAL_GPIO_TogglePin()`
- Worked with active-high and active-low LED configurations.
- Adapted the NUCLEO-F446RE PA5 LED example to the Blue Pill PC13 active-low LED for simulation.

### USART / UART

- Configured **USART2** on the primary STM32F446RE target with:
  - 115200 baud
  - 8 data bits
  - no parity
  - 1 stop bit
  - no hardware flow control
  - oversampling by 16
- Implemented polling-based UART transmission with `HAL_UART_Transmit()`.
- Implemented interrupt-driven UART transmission with `HAL_UART_Transmit_IT()`.
- Worked with UART transmission-complete callbacks using `HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback()`.
- Implemented UART transmission using DMA in normal mode with `HAL_UART_Transmit_DMA()`.
- Extended UART DMA transmission to circular mode with runtime buffer updates using `HAL_UART_TxHalfCpltCallback()` and `HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback()`.
- Configured DMA for USART2 TX on the STM32F446RE target.
- Transmitted text strings over UART.
- Converted integer values to text with `sprintf()` and transmitted them over UART.
- Connected USART2 to the Wokwi Serial Monitor for simulation.
- Used Wokwi Logic Analyzer / VCD output to inspect UART timing and inter-byte behavior.


## Project Targets

| Purpose | Board / MCU | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Primary development target | NUCLEO-F446RE / STM32F446RE | Main CubeMX/CubeIDE project |
| Simulation target | Blue Pill / STM32F103C8T6 | Used for selected earlier Wokwi exercises and retained as a reference |

Because the boards are electrically different, the simulation project is adapted where necessary rather than treated as a byte-for-byte copy of the primary project.

For example, the NUCLEO-F446RE user LED is active-high on PA5, while the Blue Pill LED on PC13 is active-low.

Build output directories such as `Debug/` and `Release/` are intentionally excluded from Git.

## Build

1. Open `STM32_Fundamentals.ioc` in STM32CubeMX or STM32CubeIDE.
2. Generate the project code if the CubeMX configuration has changed.
3. Build the project in STM32CubeIDE.
4. Build artifacts are generated locally and are not committed to the repository.

## Wokwi Testing

Selected exercises were reproduced in a separate STM32F103C8T6 project for Wokwi in VSCode.

For USART2 testing:

- `PA2` — USART2 TX
- `PA3` — USART2 RX
- Wokwi Serial Monitor was used for UART input/output testing.
- Wokwi Logic Analyzer and VCD captures were used to inspect UART timing and diagnose simulator-specific behavior.

### Simulation Limitations

Wokwi was useful for early functional testing of GPIO and basic UART behavior, but several simulator-specific differences were encountered as the exercises became more timing- and peripheral-dependent.

During interrupt-driven UART transmission testing, the configured baud rate was 115200 and the individual UART bit timing matched this value. However, VCD analysis showed additional idle gaps between transmitted UART frames. These gaps increased the total transfer duration compared with the expected hardware timing.

DMA-based UART transmission was implemented for the STM32F446RE target but could not be meaningfully validated in the STM32F103C8T6 Wokwi environment used for this project.

A further limitation was found while testing blocking UART receive. Initial VCD analysis showed that the Wokwi Serial Monitor transmitted the entered `hello` sequence at approximately 9600 baud while USART2 on the simulated STM32 was configured for 115200 baud.

USART2 was temporarily reconfigured to 9600 baud to eliminate the baud-rate mismatch. VCD analysis then confirmed that the `hello` waveform reached PA3 / USART2_RX with the expected timing, and debugging confirmed that the USART baud-rate configuration was correct.

Despite this, `HAL_UART_Receive()` did not complete and the received data did not progress through the simulated USART2 receive path.

This indicates a limitation or defect in the STM32F103 USART2 RX emulation used by Wokwi rather than an application-level baud-rate configuration issue.

Because multiple simulator-specific differences were encountered in UART timing, interrupt-driven transmission behavior, DMA support, Serial Monitor behavior, and USART2 receive emulation, Wokwi is no longer used as a validation environment for new peripheral exercises.

Existing Wokwi examples are retained as reference implementations and as a record of the earlier simulation work. Further UART, interrupt, DMA, and other timing-sensitive functionality will be validated on the physical NUCLEO-F446RE target when hardware testing becomes available.

The NUCLEO-F446RE remains the primary target of the project.
